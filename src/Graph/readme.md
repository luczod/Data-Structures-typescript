- **Graph**
  A graph is an abstract model of a network structure. A graph is a
  set of NODES (OR VERTICES) connected by EDGES. Get to know the
  graphs is important because any binary relationship can be
  represented by a graph.
  Any social network, such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+, can be
  represented by a graph. We can also use graphs to represent roads,
  flights and communications, as shown in the following image.

- **Representing a graph**
  There is NO single correct way to represent a graph among the existing
  possibilities. This will depend on the type of problem you will have
  to solve and also the type of graph. (page 300)

- **adjacent vertices**
  Directly connected, neighbors
