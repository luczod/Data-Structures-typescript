- **pure functions**
  the union, intersection and difference methods that we are implementing in this chapter do not modify the instance
  of the Set class nor the otherSet passed as a parameter. You methods or functions that have no side effect are called
  pure functions. A pure function does not modify the current instance or parameters:
  it just generates a new result. (page 183)
