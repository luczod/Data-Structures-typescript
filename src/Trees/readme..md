- **BST (Binary Search Tree)**
  As with linked lists, we will work with pointers again
  (references) to represent the connection between nodes
  (called edges in tree terminology).

- **this.compareFn(key, node.key) === Compare.LESS_THAN**
  If the node's key is less than the current node's key (in this case it is the root),
  we must check the left child of the node.
