- ### Greedy Algorithm

which we make the locally optimal choice (the best solution at the time)
at each step, hoping to find a global ideal solution (the best global solution page 382).
(the Prim, Dijkstra and Kruskal algorithms)

- ### Performance

Greedy algorithms are simpler and faster than dynamic programming algorithms.
However, they do not always provide the ideal answer.
