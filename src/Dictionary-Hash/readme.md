- **Dictionary vs Hash**
  In a dictionary (or map), we store values in pairs [key, value].
  The same goes for hashes (they store values in pairs [key, value]),
  but the way we implement these data is a little different in that
  dictionaries can only store a unique value per key, as we will see below.

  A dictionary is a lot like a set; one set stores a collection of elements [key, key],
  while a dictionary stores a collection of elements [key, value]. A dictionary is
  also known as a map, symbol table and associative array.
