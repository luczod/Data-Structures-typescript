- **pure functions**
  the union, intersection and difference methods that we are implementing in this chapter do not modify the instance
  of the Set class nor the otherSet passed as a parameter. You methods or functions that have no side effect are called
  pure functions. A pure function does not modify the current instance or parameters:
  it just generates a new result. (page 183)

- **Array.every()**
  The every method will be called as long as the callback function returns true.
  If the callback function returns false, the loop will break, which is why
  we are also changing the value of the isSubset flag on the line. (page 189)

- **Bags**
  In mathematics, we have a concept called multiset, which allows the same element
  to be inserted into the set, even if it has already been inserted before.
  You Multisets (or bags) can be very useful for counting how many times the element
  is present in a set. They are often applied in database systems. (page 194)
