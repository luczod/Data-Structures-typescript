- ### big-O notation

How can we measure the efficiency of an algorithm? In general, we use
resources such as CPU usage (time), memory usage, disk usage and
network.

- ### Logarithm

The logarithm, or log, is the inverse of the mathematical
operation of exponentiation. This means that the log of a number
is the number that a fixed base has to be raised to in order
to yield the number.By default base(b) = 10
log<sub>b</sub>x = y -> x = b<sup>y</sup>

- ### NP-complete

In general, we say that an algorithm is efficient if it has complexity
O(n<sup>k</sup>) for some constant k, and it is called a polynomial algorithm.
NP-complete problems are the most difficult of an NP set.

- ### Heuristic Algorithms

Some of the problems mentioned are impossible to solve. At the However,
some techniques can be used to obtain a solution approximated in a
satisfactory time interval. One technique would be to use heuristic algorithms.
A solution generated by heuristic methods may may NOT be the BEST SOLUTION, but
it will be GOOD ENOUGHT to solve the problem at the time. (page 406)
Heuristic from acient Greek means 'to find, discover'.
