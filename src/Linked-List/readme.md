- ### getElementAt(index: number): unknown

When exiting the loop (for), the previous variable will reference an element before the
index where we want to insert the new element, and the current variable will reference
an element after the position we would like to insert it. insert the new element.

- ### getElementAt(index - 1)

It is very important to have variables that reference the nodes to be
controlled so that the connection between them is not lost.

- ### Circular-Linked-List

The only difference between a circular linked list and a linked list is that the
pointer to the next item of the last element (tail.next) does not a reference to undefined.
In a circular doubly linked list, tail.next points to the first element and head.prev points to the last element:

- ### Sorted-Linked-List

instead of applyinga sorting algorithm, we will insert element in its
correct position a in order to keep the list always orderly.
Since we don't want to allow insertion of elements at any index,
we will start by assigning a default (index= 0) value to the index parameter (page 170)

- ### Stack-Linked-List

We are calling the DoublyLinkedList class methods for all the other methods. Use the internally
linked list data structurein stack implementation it is easier, as we do not need to create
the code from scratch, maintaining the processing cost and making the code more readable!
We can apply the same logic and create a Queue class and a
Deque using DoublyLinkedList, or even the LinkedList class!

- ### Linked-List vs Array

The main advantage of a linked list over an array is that it is possible
to easily add and remove elements from the list, without having to move
its elements. So, whenever you need to add and remove many elements,
the best option will be to use a linked list instead of an array. (page 173)
