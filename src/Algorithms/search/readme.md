- ### Binary Search Tree class (Trees)

The Binary Search Tree class has a search method
exactly the same as binary search, but applied to tree data structures

- ### Interpolation search

is an improved variation of binary search. While binary search always
checks the mid position value, interpolation search can check different
places in the array depending on the value sought

- ### Position and Delta

The idea of the formula is to find the largest value close to
position if the value sought is closest to array[high] and the
lowest value close to position if the value sought is more
next to array[low].
