- **Sorting and search algorithms**
  Initially, we must learn to order and then we will search for a
  given any information.

- **Sorting Algorithms**
  Every distribution-free sorting algorithm we will create in this
  chapter will receive the array to be sorted as a parameter,
  in addition to a comparison function. (page 334)

- **Two loop**
  Next, we have an outer loop that will do a iterate through
  the array and will control the passes (i.e. what is the nth value
  of the array that we must find next, that is, the next value
  Minimum).
  Two nested loops, responsible by quadratic complexity.
  complexity: O(n²) (page 338)

- **complexity: O(n²)**
  Two nested loops, responsible by quadratic complexity.

- **Algorithms ordering with distribution**
  Counting sort: Algorithms sort with distribution use auxiliary
  data structures (known as buckets), which are organized and then
  combined, resulting in the sorted array. (page 351)
