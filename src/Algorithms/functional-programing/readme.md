- ### Functional programing

In functional programming, we must avoid side effects and data mutable,
which means that we will not modify the data passed to the function. If
there is a need to return a solution based on the input, we can create
a copy and return the modified copy of the data.

- ### Functional programing vs Imperative

With an imperative approach, a developer writes code that specifies the
steps that the computer must take to accomplish the goal. This is sometimes
referred to as algorithmic programming. In contrast, a functional approach
involves composing the problem as a set of functions to be executed.

- ### Native in JavaScript

The map, filter and reduce functions are the
basis of functional programming in JavaScript.
