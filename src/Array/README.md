# Array

## Intention

In JavaScript, an array is a mutable object. We can easily add new elements to it. The object will dynamically grow as
as new elements are added. In several other languages, for example, in C and Java, it is necessary to determine the size of the array and, if there is a need to add more elements, an entirely new array must be created; we cannot simply add new elements to the array as they are needed.
